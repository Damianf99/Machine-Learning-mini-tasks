The aim of the task is to implement an evolutionary algorithm to find a solution for n-queens.

Genetic Algorithm is used with a novel fitness function as the Meta-heuristic. The aim of N-Queens Problem is to place N queens on an N x N chessboard, in a way so that no queen is in conflict with the others.

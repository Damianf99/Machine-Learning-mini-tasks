Implementation of the multilayer network learning algorithm (limited to 1 hidden layer) with the back propagation error algorithm.

The task is to implement the MLP neural network training algorithm using the gradient method of classification on the Iris and Ionosphere set. The network is to consist of only one hidden layer, which will facilitate calculations.

The aim of the task is to implement the Breadth First Search, Depth First Search and Best First Search algorithm in order to find a solution for the n-queen puzzle. The Best First Search algorithm uses heuristics, i.e. a function to estimate which node should be checked and expanded first. h1, h2 and h3 in the code - represent different heuristic functions in the Best First search algorithm.

The Perceptron network is the simplest type of artificial neural network.

It is a single neuron model that can be used to solve classification problems into two classes and forms the basis for the subsequent development of much larger networks.

The perceptron will estimate the class of some given sample after the learning process. The purpose of this task is to implement an algorithm called the Delta rule to change network parameters (weights).
